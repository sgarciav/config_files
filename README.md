# About

Welcome! This is an attempt at setting up my personal configuration for different systems. More to come...

# Installation

Run the get and set secripts to update the config files in the repo or set them up in the current machine, respectively,

	$ cd /path/to/scripts
	$ source set_config.sh <directory or filename> | OR
	$ source get_config.sh <directory or filename>

# Warning

The `set_config.sh` script will delete local files and replace them with the ones from the repo. There are no security checks in place, so be completely sure you want to run.
